# Binary Search
<p>The binary search program is an efficient algorithm used to find the index of a target element in a sorted list. 
  It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 
  The program compares the middle element with the target and decides whether to search the left or right half of the list, narrowing down the search space</p>
